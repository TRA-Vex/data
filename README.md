# VEX Data

These are daily database uploads containing data relating to VEX robotics competitions (VRC, VIQC, VEXU, VAIC).

Data includes everything after, and including, tipping point (season `125`). The seasons before have very inconsistent data. Timestamps are RFC 3339 formatted, and localized as UTC.

Programs:
```json
[
   {
      "id":1,
      "name":"VEX Robotics Competition",
      "abbr":"VRC"
   },
   {
      "id":4,
      "name":"VEX U",
      "abbr":"VEXU"
   },
   {
      "id":41,
